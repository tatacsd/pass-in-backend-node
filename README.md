## ðŸš€ Tecnologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)


## ðŸ’» Project
The project goal was to develop a complete application using REST API to be used by the front-end application developed in the same event using React.js.

You can access the front-end application [here](https://pass-in-web-qwwz.vercel.app/).
And the backend application [here](https://pass-in-backend-node.onrender.com/docs/static/index.html#/events/post_events).


The application is a tool for managing event participants in person. Its functionality includes:
- Creating endpoints for the manager to create new events.
- Creating endpoints to get attendees badges.
- Creating endpoints to get attendees from the event.
- Creating endpoints to check-in attendees.
- Creating endpoints to register attendees.

### ðŸ“š What I've learned with this project
- How to use Swagger and Swagger UI to document the API.
- How to use Zod to validate the data.
- How to use Faker.js to generate fake data while testing.
- How to use Prisma to interact with the database locally.
- How to use Fastify to create the server.

## :sparkles: Features
- [x] Create new events
- [x] Get attendees badges
